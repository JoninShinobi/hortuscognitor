                    Hortus Cognitor creates an engaging and immersive learning experience, that connects people to the earth and each other, fostering deep understanding of how working with the land brings about meaningful change in our own internal landscapes, our communities and the world around us.

                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 3rem; color: #ffffff;">
                    Through our courses, workshops, and community projects, we invite you to discover how natural principles can teach us about growing colourful, meaningful and powerful political and ecological change.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; color: #ffffff; text-align: center;">
                We offer transformative experiences that move beyond theory into lived understanding of natural systems, creating spaces where transformation isn't just a concept—it's a lived, growing reality.

        <h2 style="font-family: 'hey-eloise', 'Kalam', 'Patrick Hand', 'Caveat', cursive; color: #ADA228; font-size: 2.5rem; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 3rem;">About Your Tutor</h2>

        <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'hey-eloise', 'Kalam', 'Patrick Hand', 'Caveat', cursive; color: #ADA228; font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">Hannah Watkins</h3>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #333;">
                Hannah Watkins is what can only be described as besotted with vegetable growing. It is rare that people find their passion in life, but it is evident, through her continual commitment to early rising, her perpetual conversation about sprouts (or whatever vegetable is her "favourite" at the time) and over 2 acres of living, flourishing evidence at Community Harvest Whetstone, that she has found her raison d'être. Those around her, even for a few minutes, will begin to feel that obsession and it is wonderfully infectious.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #333;">
                You would probably not find out, however, that she has a 1st class bachelors degree in Social Policy and a distinction level MSc in Psychology, that she used to advise local councils on equalities and human rights, that she spent one very cold winter looking after rescued farm animals or, indeed, that she has previously managed important frontline services, such as a residential rehabilitation unit for people with acquired brain injuries and a substance misuse recovery facility, during her varied career history, because, one day, she made a plan to be a vegetable farmer and hasn't looked back since.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: #333;">
                Her old life has been swapped for carefully tended soil, hanging out with the worms and interestingly shaped aubergines. But, despite her more grounded existence these days, her prior experiences have equipped her to understand the larger systemic issues impacting on food security and access. She now holds qualifications in designing and implementing Regenerative Land-Based Systems and a Permaculture Design Certificate, having studied at the renowned Apricot Centre in Devon and, in 2023, she completed a year-long course in the Politics and Production of Seed, facilitated by The Gaia Foundation Seed Sovereignty Programme.

            <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333;">
                It is fair to say that you are in safe, muddy hands with Hannah Watkins and that she will share, without reservation, her love for growing, food systems transformation and her knowledge thereof. You will no doubt, like her, undergo a kind of transformation into joyful service of the earth, of people, and of community, as you hear what she has to say and see what she has to show.
